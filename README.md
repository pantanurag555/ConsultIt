# ConsultIt
A PHP and MySQL based web-application for a consultancy service along with its proper software development documentation

To understand the working of the web-application and its concept, please refer to the Software Requirements Specification and Software Design Specification.

Copy the 'ConsultIt Files' folder into 'www' inside your local wamp/xampp folder and run the 'LoadingPage.php' using localhost. You will need to create a 'consultit' database inside your local SQL with 2 tables: 'candidate' and 'admin'. The structure of the 2 tables will be as shown in 'candidate.jpg' and 'admin.jpg'.
